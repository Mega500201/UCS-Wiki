# Explaining Escape Variables:

can_escape: true/false
Description: Specifies whether the role can escape or not.

role_after_escape:
  default: InternalRole Spectator
  cuffed by InternalTeam ChaosInsurgency: InternalRole ClassD
Description: 
  - If we set the 'default' role (in this case, Spectator), after escaping, the custom role will change to a spectator.
  - If we set it to 'cuffed by InternalTeam team' (e.g., ChaosInsurgency), then when the custom role is cuffed by that specific team, it will change into the designated role (e.g., ClassD) after escaping.
